      <description>Introduction One of the most important steps in developing a model for machine learning is tuning hyperparameters to ensure it generalises to unseen data. A model that fits the training set well but performs poorly on anything else is useless, so care should be taken in ensuring that in-sample performance characteristics of a model are representative of real world performance also. The most simple of these methods is of course using a holdout set, which allows for an easy way to estimate performance on out-sample data but when used as part of the model iteration process, is usually is also overfit to some degree.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the problem of keyword matching including a number of approaches, applications and the Aho-Corasick algorithm.
Statement of problem To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define the keyword searching problem.
Given a list of strings \(K = [s_1, \ldots, s_n]\) (called keywords) and a (usually) much longer string \(C\) (called the corpus) count the number of times each keyword appears in the corpus.
Let \(|s_i|\) be the length of the \(i\) - th keyword and let \(m\) be the length of the corpus \(C\).</description>
