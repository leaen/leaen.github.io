      <description>Introduction In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll go over auto-regressive time series. What they are, what they look like and some properties they exhibit. Throughout the post we&amp;rsquo;ll use small snippets of R to plot processes and visualisations.
What are autoregressive time series? An auto-regressive time series is a stochastic process in which future values are modelled by a linear combination of some number of previous values of the same process. In other words, a series which is regressed on itself in order to find coefficients that relate its past values to its future values.</description>
